## Hey hi hello! 👋

If you've found me here, you probably already know a lot about me. But just in case...

- 🌱 I started programming when I was 13, after seeing a couple of high schoolers making games in [Macromedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia) [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash)
- 🎮 I love making games and web experiences and do both regularly as a hobby
- 💻 I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer on Power Automate at Microsoft
- 📚 I'm currently learning NextJS and Swift
- ⚽️ My favorite hobbies are playing soccer, scrapbooking, and studying the Japanese language—日本語で話しましょう！
- 📫 You can reach me at `contact.ek.pp8xh@aleeas.com`
